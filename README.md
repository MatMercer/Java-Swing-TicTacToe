# Java-Swing-TicTacToe
A Java Swing TicTacToe game implementation for a College Assignment.

## How it works
The TicTacToe is a JPanel. You can add more than one TicTacToe to a frame.
```java
// Add the tictactoe panel
this.add(new TicTacToePanel());
```

### How to play it
The rules are the same of a traditional TicTacToe. X starts and when there is a win or draw,
the panel notifies the user and resets the game in the next click.
